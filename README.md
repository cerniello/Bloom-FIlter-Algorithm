## Find the ***duplicates***!

Given [`passwords2.txt`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wTmOU-yqk4qdQYg42AquhzgpNGrRA96d), a 2GB file of alphanumeric passwords as input, each row corresponds to a string of 20 characters. The goal is to check whether there are some duplicate strings. Our definition of duplicate is that the two strings have the __same characters__, order is not important. Thus, "AABA" = "AAAB".

* We know In the file there are 10M duplicates, can we detect them?
* Does it happen that two strings with different characters are hashed to the same value? If yes, could you provide the number of *False Positive*?

## What is Bloom Filter?

A Bloom filter is a **space-efficient probabilistic** data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. For example, checking availability of username is set membership problem, where the set is the list of all registered username. The price we pay for efficiency is that it is probabilistic in nature that means, there might be some False Positive results. False positive means, it might tell that given username is already taken but actually it’s not.

### Interesting Properties of Bloom Filters

* Unlike a standard hash table, a Bloom filter of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements.
* Adding an element never fails. However, the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, at which point all queries yield a positive result.
* Bloom filters never generate false negative result, i.e., telling you that a username doesn’t exist when it actually exists.
* Deleting elements from filter is not possible because, if we delete a single element by clearing bits at indices generated by k hash functions, it might cause deletion of few other elements. Example – if we delete “geeks” (in given example below) by clearing bit at 1, 4 and 7, we might end up deleting “nerd” also Because bit at index 4 becomes 0 and bloom filter claims that “nerd” is not present.
